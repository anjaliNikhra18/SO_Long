Project: so_long (42 Wolfsburg)
2D Game Engine in C with MiniLibX

Built a tile-based 2D game engine from scratch featuring player movement, collectibles, and dynamic rendering - my first graphics programming experience in C.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

Implemented procedural map parsing from .ber files with validation

Created sprite-based rendering system using MiniLibX graphics library

Designed game mechanics: player movement, item collection, exit conditions

Added enemy patrol AI (bonus) with pathfinding algorithms

ðŸ”¹ Technical Highlights:

Pure C implementation following 42's strict Norminette standards

Memory-managed graphics rendering without leaks

Custom input handling system (WASD/arrow keys)

Cross-platform compatibility (Mac/Linux)

ðŸ”¹ Skills Demonstrated:

Low-level graphics programming

Game state management

Asset pipeline creation

Algorithm implementation (for bonus AI)
